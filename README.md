# RikiMorty
## Why this app?
### This app was created as a practical assignment which was required while applying a job. 
## About 3rd party libraries
### This app was written purely in swift without any 3rd party libraries. 
## Networking 
### Built-in URLSession was used for networking. As a base api url, https://rickandmortyapi.com/api was used. Additionally, Error handling techniques also were used to make app as much as closer to real wold apps.
## User Interface
### UI was fully written manually and this gives more control over app.
